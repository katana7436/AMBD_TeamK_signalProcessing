# Module -5 Applied Model Based Design
## Ambd_TeamK_signalProcessing

#
## Introduction: ##
#### Model-based design is a mathematical and visual method of addressing problems associated with designing complex control, signal processing and communication systems. In this repo group k, a team of 11, shall maintain their individual unique projects based on the either image processing or wireless communication under signal processing domain. These projects are modeled using the MatLab and simulink. The distinct projects details and the main repo folder structure is explained down.  ####
-------------------------------------------------------------------
## Folder structure ##
| Folder | Description|
| --- | --- |
|1_Model | This folder contains final integerated model |
| 2_Project_Documents | Document detailing project research, requirements and architechture|
| 3_Compliance (License Based) | License standard <br>1. Metrics_Dashboard <br>2. Model_Advisor <br>3. Model_Coverage  |
| 4_Test_Results| This folder contains all the test plans |
| 5_Embedded_C_Executable(License Based) | This folder contains code generted from the model |
| 6_Older_Models | This folder contains older versions of the integerated project  |
| 7_Video | Integerated project working video |
| 8_Scripts | Folder contains the MatLab scripts used |
| All_team_project | Individual project folder of the team is maintained here |
| Images | Contains the images used in the main repo |
| README| This file describes the overview of the project, all the required components to know about the project and collabators cotribution. |
